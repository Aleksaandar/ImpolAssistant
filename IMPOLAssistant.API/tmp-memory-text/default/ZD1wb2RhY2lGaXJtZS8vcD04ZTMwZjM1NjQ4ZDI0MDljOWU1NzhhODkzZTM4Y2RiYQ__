Lice odgovorno za informati\u010Dku bezbednost prati primenu mera i proverava da li su podaci za\u0161ti\u0107eni u skladu sa Aktom i internim procedurama. Administrator IKT sistema koordinira sa odgovornim licem za informati\u010Dku bezbednost i rukovodiocima organizacionih celina.\nPosebne mere za\u0161tite obuhvataju rad na daljinu, kori\u0161\u0107enje mobilnih ure\u0111aja, i za\u0161titu informacija tokom celokupnog \u017Eivotnog ciklusa podataka, uklju\u010Duju\u0107i kreiranje, obradu, skladi\u0161tenje, prenos, brisanje i uni\u0161tavanje informacija. Tako\u0111e, identifikuju se informaciona dobra i odre\u0111uju odgovornosti za njihovu za\u0161titu.\r\nPristup informacijama i informacionim dobrima omogu\u0107en je samo onim osobama koje imaju poslovnu \u201Cpotrebu da znaju\u201D. Pristupne grupe i profili se defini\u0161u na na\u010Din koji omogu\u0107ava dodeli ili oduzimanje prava pristupa celokupnoj grupi odjednom. Svaka osoba ima pristup samo onim informacionim dobrima, kao \u0161to su IT oprema, aplikacije, postupci, prostorije, koja su neophodna za obavljanje njenih zadataka. Fizi\u010Dka i elektronska sredstva za pristup, kao \u0161to su klju\u010Devi, identifikacione kartice, korisni\u010Dka imena i lozinke, moraju se \u010Duvati sa velikom pa\u017Enjom i ne smeju se pozajmljivati. Podaci za pristup smatraju se poverljivim, a svako gubljenje ili kra\u0111a pristupnih sredstava mora se odmah prijaviti kao informacioni bezbednosni incident.\r\nZa svaki informacioni sistem potrebno je uspostaviti proceduru za dodelu, promenu i prestanak prava pristupa. Pristup je dozvoljen samo onima koji su za to ovla\u0161\u0107eni i odgovaraju\u0107e osposobljena. Odobrenje pristupa i spre\u010Davanje neovla\u0161\u0107enog pristupa klju\u010Dni su faktori, a registracija korisnika vr\u0161i se uz odobrenje lica zadu\u017Eenog za informacionu bezbednost. Korisni\u010Dka imena moraju biti jednozna\u010Dna, i u izuzetnim slu\u010Dajevima se mo\u017Ee dozvoliti upotreba grupnih imena, ali samo iz poslovnih razloga. Korisnicima kojima je prestao radni odnos pristup se odmah onemogu\u0107ava, a svake godine vr\u0161i se preispitivanje prava korisnika.\r\nPotrebno je napomenuti da su administratorska prava odvojena od obi\u010Dnih korisni\u010Dkih prava i dodeljuju se kroz formalni postupak. Administratori moraju koristiti svoje privilegije smao kada je to apsolutno neophodno za administraciju sistema. Korisnici sa posebnim pravima ne smeju  koristiti grupna korisni\u010Dka imena, a njihova administratorska prava se redovno pregledaju i proveravaju. Pristup informacionim sistemima mora biti omogu\u0107en samo kroz odgovaraju\u0107u autentifikaciju, poput jake i komplekse lozinke ili drugih bezbednih na\u010Duna
